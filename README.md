<h1> RYGI- Rental Yeild Growth Index (Australian property insight)</h1>

 <h2>Real estate metric: Come up with a metric or insight that would be useful for Australian residential property investors </h2>

 Purpose:
 
The Rental Yield Growth Index measures how rental yields are changing over time in specific Australian suburbs or postcodes. It helps residential property investors identify areas with rising rental returns relative to property prices â€” a strong indicator of both cash flow potential and emerging demand.

<h3>Uses </h3>

- Monitors both rental yield and capital growth

-Spot emerging suburbs where yields are improving faster than prices.

- Avoids flat rental growth

<h4>Formula </h4>

RYGI= Current Rental Yield - Rental Yield 12 months ago/ Rental Yield 12 months ago x 100
